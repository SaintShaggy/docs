# DOSEMU for system scripts
***

This deals with some of the details related to running "system scripts" with DOSEMU.

In order to run old DOS applications, you need to call shell scripts (typically bash, but could be python, perl, whatever) that in turn call dosemu with the necessary DOS batch or exe file. The most common one is running the network binaries for net38. A lot of the details about file placement and WWIVnet-specific scripts can be found under 
[WWIVnet Config on Linux](../network/wwivnet_linux.md), this page is meant just as an
overview of the concept.
