You must install a telnet client application that supports ANSI color and
graphics to use all the features of this system.  Here are some shareware
and freeware clients I have used and can recommend:

###QWK Mail Readers

In the days of dialup BBSes, on popular boards you frequently had less than
you needed to read all the messages and reply, look for files, etc. To help
optimize your time, tools to allow you download messages, read offline, reply
offline and then upload your replies were created. QWK was one such 
framework and is still supported in WWIV BBS.

To download the unread messages on a WWIV BBS use the //QWK command from the
Main Menu. You will then be presented with the options to use QWK messaging.

Here's the QWK menu:

```
                      WWIV QWK Off-Line Reader Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

D)ownload Qwk Packet
C)onfig Qwk settings
U)pload Reply Packet
S) Config Subs to include
%) Set percent of all messages to download (Read OR Not)
Q)uit to Main Menu
```

Configuring the "Subs to include" let's you enable/disable downloading
messages for particular subs and this is a first good place to start.
Once that is done, you can use the Internal WWIV QWK to Download a QWK
packet. Or if you are ready to Upload you can do that here as well.

Once you have your file downloaded you will need a client to read the
QWK file, here is information such clients:

Client | Windows | Linux | OSx | Android | iOS | Windows Phone
------ | :-----: | :---: | :-: | :-----: | :-: | :-----------:
[MultiMail](http://multimail.sourceforge.net/) | X | X | X |  |
