## Waiting For Call (WFC) screen

Historically WWIV was single or multi-node, where each
node would be at the WFC screen for that node until a modem
call is received.  With WWIV, the Telnet and SSH sessions
are terminated by wwivd.

The graphical WFC screen was orginally added in v4.30, as an 
optional full screen WFC that provides information to the sysop
whenever the BBS is idle. The only reason to use the WFC screen
today is so that WWIV can automatically call out to WWIVnet
network connections as defined in callout.net.

The screen looks as follows:

 Also included is a definable screen saver.  See WWIV.INI for enabling and disabling these features.

**Logging on**  
From the keyboard, local logons are initiated from the WFC using the SpaceBar.  You will see the "Logon?" prompt.  If this is your first logon, hit Y and follow the prompts to establish your account. If you have already established your account, hit F for a "fast" logon or Y to logon normally. SL255 users numbered 1 through 10 may use a fast logon by hitting the SpaceBar and their user number.
**Note:** This feature only works for SL255 users. Once this logon process is complete, the last few callers and user information screens will be presented and you will be located at the Main Message Base prompt.

**User Online keys**  
User online keys are used to perform certain actions on the system or the user while he or she is online.

**F1 - QuickEdit User Account**  
Pressing the F1 key while a user is online will produce a pop-up box containing the current users access levels, restrictions and other pertinent information. You can tab through the fields an edit this information as needed.  Pressing F1 again closes the pop up. A [WAIT] prompt is displayed to the user while editing and all caller input is ignored. This is the first User online key you will use.  After logging on and establishing your sysop account, hit this key and give yourself maximum values as displayed below:

## Dedicated NODE for WWIVnet Connectivity
You can dedicate a node for connecting to [WWIVnet](network/wwivnet.md) 
(or [FTN Networks](network/ftn_nets.md)) so your BBS can connect and 
share files without taking the system down to users.
