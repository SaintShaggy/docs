## Known Issues

Issue | OS 
--- | ---
32-bit version of DMUD does not run | Windows7 x86 32-bit

## 16-Bit Setup

* DMUD097.ZIP is the file you want, not the 32-bit version.
* Extract the files to \wwiv\doors\dmud\
* Edit \wwiv\doors\dmud\runmud.bat. There are two lines you need to un-comment and pun in the correct the paths.
* From the command line in \wwiv\doors\dmud run CONFIG.EXE
* You can CLEAR the line about the drop file location. That will be passed in when the door is launched. You can leave the other settings as-is for now unless you know what you're doing.
* Now setup a new entry in Chain Edit
